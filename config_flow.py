Whodunnit — Home Assistant Custom Integration
config_flow.py: UI-driven configuration flow

This file defines the setup wizard that appears when a user adds Whodunnit
via Settings → Integrations → Add Integration.

The flow is intentionally simple: one step, one field. The user picks a single
entity to monitor and submits. Whodunnit creates one config entry (and therefore
one sensor) per entity.

Key design decisions:
  - One entity per config entry. This keeps state management straightforward and
    gives each tracked entity its own card in the Integrations UI.
  - Already-tracked entities are hidden from the picker to prevent duplicates,
    which is enforced here in addition to the unique_id check below.
  - The entry title is set to a slug-based fallback at creation time. The real
    friendly name is applied immediately afterwards by update_entry_title() in
    async_setup_entry (__init__.py), so the placeholder is never visible to the
    user in practice.
